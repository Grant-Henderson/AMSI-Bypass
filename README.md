<h1>PowerShell AMSI Bypass Module</h1>

Date : 5/27/2025

<h4>Purpose:</h4> 
Demonstrates a reflection-based technique to disable AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) in PowerShell 5.1 sessions.

<h4>Overview:</h4>
This module temporarily bypasses AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) in Windows PowerShell 5.1 by 
manipulating internal .NET components. AMSI is a security feature that scans scripts/memory for malicious content.

<h1>Technical Breakdown</h1>
Target: Modifies the amsiInitFailed flag in the System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils class.

<h4>Mechanism:</h4>

1. Loads the PowerShell .NET assembly.

2. Uses reflection to set the private static amsiInitFailed field to $true.

3. Tricks AMSI into believing initialization failed, disabling scans for the current session.


<h4>exampleUsage.ps1 Description:</h4>

This script bypasses AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) and logs keystrokes to keylog.txt. It demonstrates basic keylogging via Win32 API calls.

Features:

Disables AMSI detection (PowerShell 5.1).

Captures and saves pressed keys silently.

Use Case: Educational/authorized testing only.
